When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  I would use a remote repository to share work with others working on the same repository or to publicly publish the work. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would like to choose when to pull to my local so that the changes I made in my local are not replaced with the version from remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a clone of a repository created on GitHub servers for your account. Clone is a local copy of either a GitHub repository or another local repository. Branch is a copy of a repository within the same repository.

    We use Fork to copy the work of another into our own remote repository and be able to clone it locally and make modifications such that these changes to not impact the source.

    We use clone to be able to work on the changes locally in our own machine.

    We use branch to work on a new feature or concept independent of the master branch to try on a new idea or direction.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows us to review changes made locally since last pull. Also, if something goes wrong with the ongoing changes, we will be able to revert to the last good version and start over.

and what would be harder?
